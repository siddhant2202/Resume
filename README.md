# Resume-
A ‘good’ resume is important because without it you have no chance/no way of presenting your credentials for an open position.

If the resume you produce is merely an employment history, it is not ‘good’ and very likely won’t get you past the screening software (ATS) that most companies use to separate those applications that meet minimal qualifications from those that do not.

Your ‘core’ resume should already be geared to your ‘ideal’ job so that when you do see a job ad that describes a position of interest, you can simply modify it ( i.e. change wording, expand in some areas and down play others) so that your resume, while still accurately describing you does so in a way that more closely tracks with the requirements and ‘desirable’ skills as expressed in the ad.

When we write the text for an ad, we pull the information, often exactly from an approved job description or from the written specifications provided by the hiring manager.

If you are smart you will highlight every requirement and ‘desirable’ in that ad and then be sure that each and every one is specifically addressed using the same language (wording) as seen in the ad.

With that approach and a bit more effort than just downloading a ‘job history’, your resume is much more likely to be passed on to a recruiter with a very high score for matching the job requirements. It is then more likely that an invitation to interview will follow.

So, a ‘good’ resume of course has to be a true and accurate description of your skills and experience but in terms that track with a given ad whether on the company’s web site or a job board.

A good resume gets you in the door and a prepared (for the interview) candidate gets the job.

………………………………there is the true value of a GOOD resume!
